## Basics

1. SourceCode.java -> Compile (`javac source_code.java`) -> Java bytecode (SourceCode.class) ->Run by the Java Virtual Machine (`java SouceCode`)
    > Write once, run anywhere!

2. Java is syntactically similar to C/C++.

3. Every Java app must have at least **one class** and at least **one main** method (one main per app not per class.)

    ```java
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        // code
    }
    ```

4. Like in C/C++, most whitespace doesn't matter.

5. Nearly everything in Java is an object.

6. Booleans and integers are not compatible (unlike in C/C++ where you can use 1 and 0 to indicate true or false.)

7. `System.out.println()` inserts a newline, whereas `System.out.print()` doesn't. Plus, use `+` to concatenate strings:

    ```java
    int x = 1;
    System.out.println("The number is " + x);
    ```

8. `String[] list = {"hello", "world"}` for a list of strings. `{}` instead of `[]` (Unlike in Python.) `listlength = list.length` to get the length.

9. `int rand = (int) (Math.random() * 10)` to get random integers in range [0, 9]. (Math is a Java class.)

10. To use `float`, we need to append `f` to the value. This is because Java treats everything with a floating point as `double`: `float f = 3.14f`

11. Java is only passing by value.

12. Instead of using `private:` and `public:` like in C++, Java uses individual `private` and `public` before variables and methods:

    ```java
    public class foo {

        private int x = 42; // Initialization allowed.
        public void bar() {
            // code
        }
    }
    ```

13. Instance variables always get a default value, even if we don't initialize it: `int 0`; `float 0.0`; `boolean false`; `reference null`.

14. Use `==` for primitive types and references; `.equals()` for different objects (for example string objects). (`==` checks the reference/address and `.equals` checks the content.)

    ```java
    public class Test { 
        public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s1 = new String("HELLO");
        String s2 = new String("HELLO");
        System.out.println(s1 == s2); // false
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true
        }
    }
    ```

15. Java also has the easier for loop (or officially, "the enhanced for loop") like in Python: `for (int number : numbers)`, `:` means in.

16. `Integer.parseInt("42")` converts a string to an int using the Java Integer class.

17. `&&` and `||` are short circuit operators, which means Java only checks for the left side if it suffices to determine the entire statement.

18. The Stack and the Heap:
    * The Stack: all method invocations and local variables (aka, stack variables) live here.
        * The method on the top of the stack is always the currently executing method. When it's removed from the stack, the method is executed, which the executing sequence for constructor chaining.
    * The Heap: **all** objects live here. Also know as the garbage-collectible heap.
        * Instance variables live inside the objects.
    * If the local variable is a reference to an object, the variable (the reference) goes on the stack, and the object is still on the heap.

19. All methods in Math are static, so we only need the Math class instead of instances: `int x = Math.min(1,2)`.

20. `final` means we can't change the variable value/ override the method/ extend the class.

21. Number to string: `"" + x;` (`+` is overloaded); or `Integer.toString(x);`

22. C `printf()` like formatting:

    ```java
    String s = String.format(%d, 1);
    System.out.println(s);
    ```

23. `StringBuilder` is a mutable class that's alternate to the `String` class, which is immutable. It has the `.append()` method.

## Constructors

1. Always write a default constructor. Different constructors are essentially overloaded.

2. Constructor chaining: all the constructors in the inheritance tree must be run for a new object.

3. Invoking a superclass constructor: just call `super();`. If we don't add this, the compiler will add it for us.

    ```java
    public class Bar extends Foo {
        public Bar(String name) {
            super(name); // MUST BE THE FIRST STATEMENT!!!
            // code
        }
    }
    ```

4. Invoking an overloaded constructor: call `this();`. However, we can only call `this()` **OR** `super()`, **never both** inside a constructor.

    ```java
    public class Bar extends Foo {
        String name;
        public Bar() {
            this("Hello"); // MUST BE THE FIRST STATEMENT!!!
            // code
        }
        public Bar(name) {
            // code
        }
    }
    ```

## References and Garbage Collection

1. All object references are the same size regardless of the actual size of the object. And we can't do pointer arithmetic like in C for reference variables.

2. Garbage collection:

    ```java
    Book b = new Book();
    Book c = new Book();
    // By far, 2 references and 2 objects.
    Book d = c; // d and c refer to the same object
    // 3 references and 2 objects.
    c = b; // c refers to b's object now
    // 3 references and 2 objects.
    ```

    ```java
    Book b = new Book();
    Book c = new Book();
    b = c; // b and c refer to the same object
    // 2 references, 1 reachable object, 1 abandoned object.
    // b's original object eligible for garbage collection
    c = null; //null reference
    // 1 active reference, 1 reachable object
    ```

3. Array of objects:

    ```java
    Book[] books;
    books = new Book[10];
    // By far, only an array of references, no objects created.
    // To create the objects:
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        Book[i] = new Book();
    }
    ```

## Java API (the Java Library)

1. ArrayList: (inside the java.util (utility) class) (for primitive types, Java 5 and above enabled autoboxing: `ArrayList<Integer>`)

    ```java
    import java.util.*
    class Foo {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            ArrayList<String> A = new ArrayList<String>();
            A.add("hello");
            A.add("world");
            System.out.println("Size is: " + A.size());
            System.out.println("Contains hello? " + A.contains("hello"));
            System.out.println("Index of hello? " + A.indexOf("hello"));
            A.remove("hello"); // by value
            A.remove(0); // by index
            System.out.println("Empty? " + A.isEmpty());
        }
    }
    ```

2. System, String, and Math all belong to the java.lang package.

3. `import` in Java is simply a way to tell Java the full name of the class. Unlike in C/C++'s `include`, `import` does **not** make the program larger. Plus, we always get the java.lang package pre-imported.

## Inheritance

1. Subclass extends the superclass: `public class B extends class A {}`.

2. JVM always picks the right method, namely the most specific version.

3. Use the IS-A and HAS-A logic. If B extends A, B IS-A A. However, if A has B, they're only related (B as the instance variable of A) but not inherited.

4. In case we want to add more things for a method instead of overriding it, we can call the parent method by using `super`: `foo() {super.foo(); // more code}`

5. Public members are inherited; private members are not.

6. Multiple inheritance: (Diamond Problem/ Deadly Diamond of Death(DDD)):
    * No multiple inheritance by classes like in C++;
    * Achieved only by using `interface` and `implements`:

        ```java
        public class foo {}
        public interface bar1 {} // all methods abstract
        public interface bar2 {} // all methods abstract
        public class foobar extends foo implements bar1, bar2 {}
        ```

## Polymorphism

1. With polymorphism, the reference type can be a superclass of the object type.

    ```java
    Animal[] animals = new Animal[2];
    animals[0] = new Dog();
    animals[1] = new Cat();
    for (Animal animal : animals) {
        animal.make_sound(); // mew and bark
    }
    ```

2. We can also have polymorphic arguments and return types. (When a superclass type is requested, a subclass is sufficient to use.)

3. Rules for overriding:
    * Arguments must be the same, and return types must be compatible.
    * The method can't be less accessible.

4. Abstract:
    * Use `abstract` to make the base class abstract. `public abstract class animal {}` (can't be instantiated.) 
    * Use `abstract` to make a method abstract `public abstract void eat();` (also no method body!)
    * Abstract methods must be put in abstract classes.
    * We must implement abstract methods by overriding.

5. Every class in Java extends the Object class which has the methods like: `.equals()`, `.hashCode()`, `.getClass()`.

## Static

1. No objects involved for static methods. Only use the class name to invoke it.

    ```java
    public static int min(int a, int b) {// code}
    ...
    Math.min(1,2);
    ```

2. All static variables are initialized before any object can be created.

    ```java
    public class foo {
        static int count = 0;
        public increment() {
            count++;
        }
    }
    ```

3. Static final variables are constants: `public static final double PI = 3.141592653589793;` (In uppercase by convention.) Or we can use the static initializer which runs before any code in the class:

    ```java
    public class foo {
        static {
            // code
        }
    }
    ```

4. Static importing is allowed but might be confusing:

    ```java
    import static java.lang.System.out;
    import static java.lang.Math.*;
    ...
    out.println(sqrt(2.0));
    ...
    ```

## Exceptions

1. Similar to the C++ try and catch block.

2. The method that throws must declare `throws Exception`:

    ```java
    public void foo() throws BadException {
        // code
        throw new BadException();
    }
    ```

3. The `finally` block **always runs** no matter what:

    ```java
    try {
        // code
    } catch (//some exception) {
        // code
    } finally {
        // code
    }
    ```

4. Exceptions can be polymorphic (using the superclass type.)

## Input and output

1. Be sure to use try and catch for IOException.

2. Serialization: (If data will only be used by the Java programmed that generated it.) (The object graph is saved.)

    ```java
    import java.io.*;
    public class foo implements Serializable { // all subclasses are also serializable
        transient String PIN; // use transient if can't/ shouldn't be saved
    }
    ...
        FileOutputStream fstream = new FileOutputStream("file.ser");
        ObjectOutputStream ostream = new ObjectOutputStream(fstream);
        ostream.writeObject(o_1);
        ostream.close();
    ```

3. Deserialization: restoring an object.

    ```java
    FileInputStream fstream = new FileInputStream("file.ser");
    ObjectInputStream ostream = new ObjectInputStream(fstream);
    Object one = ostream.readObject(o_1);
    Foo one = (Foo) one;
    ostream.close();
    ```

4. Plain text: (If data will by used by other programs.)

    ```java
    FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("file.txt");
    writer.write("hello world.");
    writer.close();
    ```
