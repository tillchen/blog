## Basics

1. SourceCode.java -> Compile (`javac source_code.java`) -> Java bytecode (SourceCode.class) ->Run by the Java Virtual Machine (`java SouceCode`)
    > Write once, run anywhere!

2. Java is syntactically similar to C/C++, which means semicolons `;` are important! (Unlike Python :satisfied:)

3. Every Java app must have at least **one class** and at least **one main** method (one main per app not per class.)

    ```java
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        // code
    }
    ```

4. Like in C/C++, most whitespace doesn't matter.

5. Nearly everything in Java is an object.

6. Booleans and integers are not compatible (unlike in C/C++ where you can use 1 and 0 to indicate true or false.) Plus, true and false are in **lowercase** (unlike in Python.)

7. `System.out.println()` inserts a newline, whereas `System.out.print()` doesn't. Plus, use `+` to concatenate strings:

   ```java
   int x = 1;
   System.out.println("The number is " + x);
   ```
