## Dynamic Programming

1. The two key ingredients:
   * optimal substructure: The optimal solution contains the optimal solutions to subproblems.
       * The subproblems need to be independent, which means the solution to one subproblem does not affect the solution to another subproblem.
   * overlapping subproblems
