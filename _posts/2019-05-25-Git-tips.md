## .gitignore

1. When we want to ignore certain files or folders, create a .gitignore file and add the file/folder name inside:

   ```text
    file.txt # a single file
    folder/ # a folder named `folder`
    *.txt # all txt files
   ```

2. If a file is already tracked, use `git rm --cached foo.txt` to remove it first from the git repo.

## Log

1. When we want to get a simpler version of the log, use `git log --pretty=oneline`.

## Reverting

1. Use `git checkout .` to revert to the last commit before adding the new changes.

2. Use `git checkout` plus the first 6 characters of the reference ID to check out the old commits. This enters the detached HEAD state. And it's best ***not to make changes*** when checking out old commits. Use `git checkout master` to go back the master branch.

3. Use `git reset --hard` plus the first 6 character of the reference ID to reset the project to the old commit.

## Deleting a repository

1. We can either delete the .git directory in a file browser or use `rm -rf .git`.
