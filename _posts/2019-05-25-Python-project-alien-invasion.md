title: "Python project: Alien Invasion"
---

Today I finished my first big project called Alien Invasion using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org):

You can check out [the github repository](https://github.com/tillchen/Alien_Invasion) and try the game.

I'd say the coding has been very enjoyable. And I feel enormous pleasure when my friends and I play the game I programmed:)

By doing this fun project, I learned many things, including:

* how to handle big projects;
* code refactoring.

Plus, it strengthed my coding skills in python and my love for programming:D!

Some statistics:

According to [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/), I coded 13 hours and 46 minutes in total for this project (excluding the time for thinking and planning) and more than 8 hours for the main module alien_invasion.py.
